Use this table below as a template to report your findings:

Algo	AUC	ACCURACY	TPR	FPR	TNR	FNR
LR	 	 	 	 	 	 
NB	 	 	 	 	 	 
kNN (k=3,k=5)	 	 	 	 	 	 
















Rubric: 15%

Summarize and provide a explanatory commentary on the observed performance of these classifiers.

1) Help your client understand that you have selected an appropriate model that has the capacity to learn.

2) Help your client understand that when deployed your model is capable of generalizing.

So to get full credit you will build two tables like the one shown above

one on the models' ability OR capacity to learn

and the other one on the model's ability to generalize.

Rubric: 15% 

(What aspects of the data and or aspects of the algorithms, explain these performance differences)





THESE ARE WICKED-SCIENCE PROBLEMS AND THERE IS NO PRECISE ANSWER. Please base your

observations on common-sense,facts with appropriate citation. 

--------------------

There is a deadline consistent with my earlier announcement -- but I do not enforce deadlines while you are learning ...

* it does not matter at what rate you learn what matters is at what rate you apply when you are called upon to solve a real problem *

I expect you to gather and prepare to run these for 15 minutes

load the data 5 minutes

run each model and gather performance measures 5 to 10 minutes each

organize and print table 15 minutes

summary and analysis 15 minutes 3 sentences per algorithm
